        <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge
            of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

            The structure was built iIn 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh,
            the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the unique
            structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

            It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small
            windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice design
            was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without
            being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus
            making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many people see the
            Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.[5]

            In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to the
            monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568 million.[6] The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve the
            historical monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it.[7] The
            palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, and arched roofs
            are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has delicately modelled hanging
            cornices.

                HAWA MAHAL 
JAIPUR’S MAGNIFICENT ICONIC LANDMARK
The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”. 


The main purpose behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the royal family and the court to observe the busy streets of the Johari Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been built without a foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for centuries. 


The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building resembles the crown of Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal architectural styles. The Rajput style can be seen in the domes canopies and the fluted pillars, while the stone inlay filigree work and the arches are perfect depictions of the Mughal style of architecture.
